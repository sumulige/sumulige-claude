## Clarification Questions & Responses

## Clarification Questions

> Based on the feasibility analysis, the following questions need clarification:

### Scope & Priorities
1. **MVP Scope**: What is the minimum viable scope for the first iteration?
   - [ ] Define core features that must be in v1.0
   - [ ] Identify features that can be deferred to later versions

2. **Priority Order**: Which features are highest priority?
   - [ ] Rank features by business value
   - [ ] Identify any dependencies between features

### Technical Decisions
3. **Tech Stack Confirmation**: Confirm the recommended technology choices
   - [ ] Frontend: See Phase 1
   - [ ] Backend: See Phase 1
   - [ ] Any constraints or preferences?

4. **Integration Points**: Are there existing systems to integrate with?
   - [ ] APIs to connect to
   - [ ] Data migration needs
   - [ ] Third-party service dependencies

### Success Definition
5. **Success Criteria**: How will we know this project is successful?
   - [ ] Define measurable outcomes
   - [ ] Set success metrics for post-launch

### Constraints
6. **Timeline Constraints**: Any deadline requirements?
   - [ ] Hard deadlines (e.g., launch date)
   - [ ] Time constraints for specific phases

7. **Resource Constraints**: Any limitations on resources?
   - [ ] Budget constraints
   - [ ] Team size/skills availability
   - [ ] Infrastructure limitations
